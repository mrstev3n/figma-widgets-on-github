#### Whose turn is it? (by Elynn Lee) ![FigJam only tag](assets/figjam-only.svg)

A FigJam widget to help your group take turns! Keep track of whose turn it is, who’s already gone, and who’s left.

Allow people to “popcorn” to others and choose who goes next, or use the “next” button to randomly choose the next person. As people join or leave, you can also “refresh” the list of people to reflect who’s still in the file.
